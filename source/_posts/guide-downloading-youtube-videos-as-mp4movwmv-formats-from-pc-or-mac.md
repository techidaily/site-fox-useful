## Guide: Downloading YouTube Videos as MP4/MOV/WMV Formats From PC or Mac

### Overview

* I can not open 10 play videos outside of Australia, but I need to stay in other countries for a long holiday. So boring. Is there any method to solve my problem? Or what 10 play downloader can help me to download many 10 play videos for my long holiday?

10 play is Network Ten's multi-platform catch up TV website where users can stream many full episodes and exclusive video files for free. 10 play is free for users and can be available on many browsers and devices, but 10 play is not available in every country and has the time period for being hosted on 10 play, usually 30 days since its first appearance on 10 play. The region and time availability limitations bring too much inconvenience to users and these users search a lot to find a solution to this. Now the following article just introduces a professional 10 play downloader - Allavsoft to help users out of the inconvenience.
